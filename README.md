#  Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Analysis: A Conceptual and Practical Framework

This repo serves as a supplement of the publication with the title referenced above. Instead of providing full scripts, we present here snippets that guide the reader on how to conduct specific tasks described in the publication.

Unless otherwise indicated, all examples presented hereafter are based on the 10X genomics dataset derived using the Single Cell 3' v3 chemistry named Parent_NGSC3_DI_PBMC. The dataset is described [here](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/4.0.0/Parent_NGSC3_DI_PBMC/Parent_NGSC3_DI_PBMC_web_summary.html).
